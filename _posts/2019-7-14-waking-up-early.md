When I tell people that I usually get up at 5 AM, they raise their eyebrows. The thought that probably passes through their minds is: "Why the hell would he want to get up before the sunrise?!"

<div style="text-align:center">

    <i>so early</i>
</div>

I'm doing it for a number of reasons:
- I'm a morning person. In the evenings I'm usually too tired to function properly but in the morning I'm far more energetic.
- I do morning workouts. Let's face it, going to the gym after a long work day when it's fully occupied isn't fun. So I go as soon as it opens, it's quiet and I get to save precious time.
- I get things done before going to work. I do yoga and strech my body, eat breakfast and drink some coffee. Those are things I wouldn't have done had I to wake up and go to work immediately.

Obviously I wasn't always waking up in these hours and when I started I had a few challenges. At first I would setup an alarm clock but stop it as soon as it would ring and go back to sleep in my comfortable bed. Then I tried setting up multiple alarm clocks which also had no affect (who was I kidding? it's basicly no different than snoozing). Lastly before last, I tried using an alarm clock that wakes you in between the sleep cycles. It's supposed to be a more "smooth" wakeup but most of the times it was inaccurate and I wouldn't wake in the hours I wanted to.

After trying for a couple of weeks I started to give up and then I reached the perfect solution for me. My magic solution was using an app named [Alarmy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=droom.sleepIfUCan&hl=en).
Using this app I could setup an alarm clock that I could turn off only by scanning a barcode, so I chose my... salt shaker!
Sounds funny but if you think this through, it forces me to wakup from my bed, turn on the lights, go to the kitchen and search for the salt shaker that isn't always in the same place and by the time I turn off the alarm I'm already awaked so I wash my face and get ready for the day.

I won't lie to you. If you don't have an important enough reason to wakeup this method above probably wouldn't work either. However, I believe it will help those that just need a little push to start their day.

Try it for yourself and tell me about your experience. Have a productive day!
